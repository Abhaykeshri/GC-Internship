## Task 1:

Here is an in depth look at the task at hand and how it benefits your career growth. (Use this kind of language/keywords in your resume)

    Create a directory structure as shown in the video:

    Learning: Understanding how to organize code and project files in a structured manner.
    Insight: Importance of maintaining a clear and organized directory structure for code readability and maintainability.
    Contribution: Improved project structure for better collaboration and scalability.

    Use clean Code Practices:

    Learning: Applying principles like readability, maintainability, and simplicity in writing code.
    Insight: The impact of clean code on debugging, collaboration, and long-term project health.
    Contribution: Enhancing code quality and making it easier for others to understand and contribute.

    Create requirements.txt:

    Learning: Understanding dependency management and version control for Python projects.
    Insight: The importance of specifying project dependencies for reproducibility.
    Contribution: Facilitating a smooth setup for others by providing a clear list of dependencies.

    Use black to format the code:

    Learning: Applying automated code formatting tools for consistency.
    Insight: The role of code formatters in maintaining a consistent style across the codebase.
    Contribution: Consistent and automatically formatted code for improved readability.

    Use flake8 to check the code:

    Learning: Performing static code analysis to identify potential issues and adherence to coding standards.
    Insight: The benefits of static analysis in catching errors and maintaining code quality.
    Contribution: Code that meets coding standards and is less prone to bugs and issues.

    Use Pytest to test the code:

    Learning: Writing and running unit tests for code reliability and functionality.
    Insight: The significance of testing in identifying and preventing bugs.
    Contribution: Ensuring that the code functions as intended and providing a safety net for future changes.

    For the same Google script, implement all these guides:

    Learning: Integrating multiple tools and practices into a real-world project.
    Insight: Practical application of best practices for a cohesive development workflow.
    Contribution: A fully-optimized and well-structured project that adheres to industry best practices.
